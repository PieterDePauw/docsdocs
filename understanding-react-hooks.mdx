React Hooks are a powerful feature introduced in React 16.8. They allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. This means you can write all your components as functions, making your code more concise and easier to understand.

## Why Hooks?

Hooks solve several problems that developers faced with class components:

1. **Reusing stateful logic between components** was challenging.
2. **Complex components became hard to understand**.
3. **Classes confuse both people and machines**.

## Common Hooks

Here are some of the most commonly used hooks:

### useState

`useState` allows you to add state to functional components.

### useEffect

`useEffect` lets you perform side effects in function components.

## Conclusion

Hooks are a game-changer in React development. They allow you to write more concise and reusable code, making your applications easier to build and maintain.
